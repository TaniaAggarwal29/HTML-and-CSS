/* CALCULATE SPECIFICITY

write four digits:
1. no. of inline style attributes
2. no. of id selectors
3. no. of class selectors
4. no. of attribute selectors

This will give you a number which can be used to compare specificity of two(or more) styles and check that which style will take effect over which.

*/

/* For example, in above style:

1. no. of inline style attributes = 0
2. no. of id selectors = 1 (container)
3. no. of class selectors = 1 (my-songs)
4. no. of attribute selectors = 3 (div, ul, li)

therefore, specificity = 0113 = 113
